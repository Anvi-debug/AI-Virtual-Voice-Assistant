# 🎙️ Virtual Voice Assistant (AI-Powered)

An AI-powered virtual voice assistant capable of **listening to voice input, understanding natural language, and generating intelligent responses** using modern **LLMs, speech processing, and backend APIs**.
The system is designed to simulate assistants like **Siri / Gemini**, with a focus on modular architecture and extensibility.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎧 **Speech-to-Text (STT)** – Converts real-time voice input into text
* 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** – Interprets user intent using LLMs
* 💬 **Context-Aware Responses** – Generates intelligent, conversational replies
* 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** – Converts responses back into human-like speech
* 🌐 **API-Based Backend** – Clean REST APIs for scalability and integration
* 🧩 **Modular Design** – Easy to plug in new models or services

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The assistant listens to user voice input via microphone
2. Audio is converted into text using STT models
3. The text is passed through a prompt-engineered pipeline
4. An LLM processes the query and generates a response
5. The response is converted into speech and played back
